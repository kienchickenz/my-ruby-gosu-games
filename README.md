# my-ruby-gosu-games

This repository is a collection of game projects written in Ruby, primarily following examples and exercises from the book 'Learn Game Programming with Ruby: Bring Your Ideas to Life with Gosu' by Mark Sobkowicz. Each game is organized as a separate folder, showcasing my learning journey with the Gosu library for creating 2D games in Ruby. 

These projects were developed as part of my self-study efforts to improve my Ruby programming skills and gain experience in game development.
